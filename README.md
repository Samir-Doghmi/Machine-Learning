This article discuss about predicting diabetes with a set of easy to get features
(does not require medical visit) through the KNIME platform. We compare
various models and, after chosing MLP, we optimize itâ€™s parameters and make
feature selection. We also create two data apps that can be deployed to a
KNIME server: an interactive dashboard for data exploration and an app to
predict diabetes with the chosen trained model.
